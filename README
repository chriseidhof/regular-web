To compile from source, do:

> cabal configure && cabal build

This will possibly indicate that you have missing packages, which you can
install via cabal.

Or if you want to install the package, execute the following command at
top-level:

> cabal install

Alternatively, you can just clone the package and load Example.lhs in your GHCi.

It may complain that it can't find some modules, that is because all the library
code is in the src directory. You can solve this by changing (or creating) the
.ghci file in your home directory to include the line ":set -i.:./src" (without the
quotes).
